# smf-discord-chat
Simple chat bot to sync SMF shoutbox and a Discord channel

This bot will sync messages sent between the web based shoutbox and a channel on your Discord server.  The web based shoutbox can function without the bot, meaning you have a backup web chat in the event Discord goes down.

The web based chat uses permission groups from SMF which you will need to confiure as outlined below.
